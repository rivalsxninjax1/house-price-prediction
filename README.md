# House Price Prediction

This project is an end-to-end machine learning example designed to predict house prices based on several features (e.g., area, number of rooms, location, etc.). The goal is to build a regression model that can be used to estimate the value of houses given certain parameters. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Overview

House price prediction is a common task in data science and machine learning. In this project, we use a dataset that contains different features of houses to build a regression model using popular algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or more advanced methods (depending on your implementation). The steps include:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understand the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.).
3. **Model Training:** Build a regression model and tune its hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.
5. **Visualization:** Plot actual vs. predicted prices and feature importance graphs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of house features along with their sale prices. Example features include:

- **Area:** Total area of the house (in square feet or square meters).

> **Note:** You can find many public datasets for house prices on websites such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php). For this example, please place your CSV file (e.g., `house_prices.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

## Features

- Data exploration using pandas and visualization libraries (Matplotlib/Seaborn)
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
- Model training using scikit-learn’s regression models
- Evaluation of the regression model with performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)
- Plotting predicted vs. actual values, and feature importance if applicable
